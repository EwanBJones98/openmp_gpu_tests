--- COMPILER ---
    1. GCC does not currently support the `declare mapper` directive.
    2. CLANG 15.0+ should however, support this, so you will need use this to compile.
        See this page for compiler testing (https://godbolt.org/z/KG46ezvPa).
    3. On Cuillin, clang 16 can be loaded with the `aocc` module.
